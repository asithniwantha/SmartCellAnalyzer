### Next Steps

The documentation is now clean, current, and maintainable. Future updates should:
1. Keep documentation concise and focused
2. Remove temporary docs after issues are resolved
3. Update existing docs rather than creating new ones
4. Consolidate related information
5. Archive outdated content rather than deleting (if historical value)
