**Smart Cell Analyzer** is an openâ€‘source hardware + firmware project for testing and monitoring rechargeable batteries.  
It combines **XL4015 buck converters**, **INA3221 current/voltage sensing**, and **PCA9685 PWM control** under the supervision of an **RP2040 microcontroller**.

## Features
- Charge and discharge profiling for NiMH and Liâ€‘ion cells
- Realâ€‘time current, voltage, and capacity logging
- Softwareâ€‘controlled safety cutoffs (OVP, OCP, OTP, timeout)
- Modular design for multiâ€‘channel expansion
- Data logging for capacity (mAh, Wh) and cycle analysis
