# ðŸ”§ Import Error Fixed!

## The Problem

You got this error:
```
ImportError: no module named 'ina3221_wrapper'
```

This happened because MicroPython on the Pico needs a simpler file structure than our organized development structure.

## The Solution

I've created a **dual structure** approach:

### 1. Development Structure (What You See in Repo)
```
firmware/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/              # Organized for development
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ drivers/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/
â”œâ”€â”€ examples/
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â””â”€â”€ docs/
```

### 2. Deployment Structure (What Goes on Pico)
```
firmware/deploy/      # Flat structure for MicroPython
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”œâ”€â”€ battery_charger_controller.py
â”œâ”€â”€ ina3221_wrapper.py
â”œâ”€â”€ adafruit_ina3221.py
â”œâ”€â”€ pca9685.py
â”œâ”€â”€ config.py
â””â”€â”€ boot.py
```

## How to Use

### Step 1: Generate Deployment Files

Run this command from the `firmware/` directory:

```bash
cd firmware
python prepare_deploy.py
```

This creates a `deploy/` folder with all files flattened and ready for upload.

### Step 2: Upload to Your Pico

**Upload ALL files from `firmware/deploy/` folder to your Pico's root directory.**

Using Thonny:
1. Open Thonny
2. Navigate to `firmware/deploy/`
3. Select all `.py` files
4. Right-click â†’ "Upload to /"

Using VS Code + MicroPico:
1. Open the `deploy/` folder files
2. Upload each to Pico root

### Step 3: Test

In Pico's REPL:
```python
import main
main.run()
```

## Files Created/Updated

âœ… `firmware/prepare_deploy.py` - Script to generate deployment files  
âœ… `firmware/deploy/` - Folder with ready-to-upload files  
âœ… `firmware/MICROPYTHON_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Detailed deployment guide  
âœ… `firmware/deploy/README.md` - Instructions for deploy folder  
âœ… Updated `.gitignore` - Excludes deploy folder from git  
âœ… Fixed `main.py` imports in deploy folder  

## Why This Approach?

### Benefits:
1. âœ… **Clean development** - Organized folder structure in repo
2. âœ… **Easy deployment** - Simple flat structure for Pico
3. âœ… **Best of both worlds** - Professional development, simple deployment
4. âœ… **Automated** - Script handles the conversion
5. âœ… **No conflicts** - Deploy folder is git-ignored

### Workflow:
1. Edit files in `src/` directory
2. Run `prepare_deploy.py`
3. Upload `deploy/` files to Pico
4. Test and iterate

## Quick Reference

### To make changes:
1. Edit files in `firmware/src/`
2. Run `python prepare_deploy.py`
3. Upload new files from `deploy/` to Pico

### To test on Pico:
```python
import main
main.run()
```

### To stop:
Press **Ctrl+C** in REPL

## What's Next?

Your Pico should now work! The deploy folder has:
- âœ… Simple imports that MicroPython understands
- âœ… All necessary files in one place
- âœ… Correct file structure for Pico

Just upload the files from `firmware/deploy/` and you're good to go! ðŸš€

## Troubleshooting

**Still getting import errors?**
- Make sure ALL files from deploy/ are uploaded
- Check they're in Pico's root, not in subfolders
- Reset Pico: Ctrl+D in REPL

**Script not working?**
- Make sure you're in the firmware/ directory
- Check Python is installed on your computer

**Need help?**
- See `firmware/MICROPYTHON_DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed guide
- See `firmware/deploy/README.md` for upload instructions
